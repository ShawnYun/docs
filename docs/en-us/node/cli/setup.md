# Installing Neo-CLI

You can choose one of the following ways to install Neo-CLI:

- Install the official Neo-CLI released package
- or publish Neo-CLI source code from GitHub into an executable file. If you use macOS, this way is highly recommended.

This document will describe the two installation ways.

## Installing the Neo-CLI package

1. Download the latest [Neo-CLI](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli/releases) package according to your operating system on Github and unzip it.

2. On Linux, install the LevelDB and SQLite3 dev packages. For example, on ubuntu 18.04 run the following:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libleveldb-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libunwind8-dev
   ```

   If using Windows, you can skip this step as those files are already included in the installation package.

You can download and compile the Neo-CLI source directly from Github.
